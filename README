Required software to run the system:

node.js
npm

To run the system, download the repository, and install the dependencies with npm install.(Note: If you are running on a mac, remove the 'devDependencies' section of the package. These dependencies are only needed for running the test suite and are imcompatible with mac.)

Once the dependencies are installed, run the application by executing node app.js in the primary folder, then navigate to localhost:8000/app.html. 

To see the examples, please visit the project page at [https://offenwanger.github.io/moments/](https://offenwanger.github.io/moments/) 

Good luck.
