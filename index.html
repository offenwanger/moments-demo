    <p id="abstract">
        Migration often fragments cultural heritage, distributing it across geographies and generations.
        While immersive experiences have the potential to bridge these cultural divides, current immersive tools require
        technical expertise that excludes many migrants from narrating their own stories.
        We present MomentsVR, an accessible authoring system that empowers migrants to create and share immersive
        narratives of their personal experiences.
        Through importing surround imagery, 2D and 3D content, and ambient audio, users can reconstruct meaningful
        places and narratives, linking them with teleporters for fluid narrative transitions.
        The system also supports audio annotations and visual emphasis techniques, such as blurring, focusing and
        warping to highlight subjective experiences.
        Our work showcases MomentsVR as a means of democratizing immersive storytelling, allowing migrants to curate,
        share, and reimagine their cultural experiences across immersive spaces.
