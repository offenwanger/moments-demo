    <p id="abstract">
        Immersive experiences can help bridge cultural divides through perspective taking, but typically must be
        authored by people with programming expertise.
        We present <i>Moments</i>, a system for non-experts to create and share immersive narratives of personal
        experiences, specifically focusing on experiences of migration.
        The author can recreate personal contexts through importing surround imagery, 2D and 3D content, and ambient
        audio. These contexts can be linked together with teleporters, enabling narrative transitions.
        The author integrates their subjective experience through audio annotation and the emphasis of parts of the
        surround imagery via blurring, focusing, and warping.
        This work demonstrates the Moments authoring system and a small gallery of narratives authored in the tool.

                    end of the set is marked by a white marker, the start being fall of 2021, the end early 2023, new
